// Write a C++ program that takes two strings as input from the user and concatenates them. Then, output the concatenated string.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    string word1;
    string word2;
    cin>>word1;
    cin>>word2;
    
    cout<<word1+word2<<endl;
}

Write a C++ program that takes five grades (integers) as input from the user and calculates the average grade. Output the average grade to the user.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    
    int a,b,c,d,e;
    cout<<"Enter grade 1 :: ";
    cin>>a;
    cout<<"Enter grade 2 :: ";
    cin>>b;
    cout<<"Enter grade 3 :: ";
    cin>>c;
    cout<<"Enter grade 4 :: ";
    cin>>d;
    cout<<"Enter grade 5 :: ";
    cin>>e;
   
    
    float avg=0;
    
    float sum=a+b+c+d+e;
    
    avg=sum/5;
    
    cout<<"average of five grade is :: "<<avg;
    
    return 0;
  
}

Write a C++ program that takes an integer as input from the user and outputs its square.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num;

    cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    cin >> num;

    int square = num * num;

    cout << "The square of " << num << " is " << square << endl;

    return 0;
}
